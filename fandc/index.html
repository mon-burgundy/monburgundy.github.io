      <h2 id="intro">Hi there...</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm really sorry for submitting my website and prerequisites so late. I lost a loved one to suicide last Wednesday (the beautiful boy with his arm around me in the photo), and became so overwhelmed with heartache and grief that concentrating became difficult to say the least.
      <br>
      <br>
      I wrote to Yvonne requesting an extension, but her advice was to submit what I have and the circumstances would be taken into consideration. If there‚Äôs one thing 2020 has taught me it‚Äôs that we must keep on keeping on, so I decided to persevere and complete my application. Thank you kindly in advance for bearing with me during these strange and incredibly difficult times.

      <h2 id="about">A bit about me...</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm Mon. In ordinary circumstances, I‚Äôm an energetic go-getter, with an unquenchable thirst for life. Originally from Australia, I headed to the Motherland close to 3 years ago.
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Why leave behind 360 days a year of sunshine and high paying jobs you ask?</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      I originally started my career in property development, but kept coming up with technology solutions to property problems. One of my ideas was ‚ÄòSkyburb‚Äô (building suburbs in the sky) - a social network for connecting residents in apartment buildings. I wanted to tackle the problem of isolation, loneliness and lack of community inhabitants feel due to limited opportunity for neighbourly interactions.
      <br>
      <br>
      I worked on the idea for about 6 months, but realised it didn‚Äôt matter how good my idea was, it‚Äôs all about the execution! And I didn‚Äôt know the first thing about tech!
      <br>
      <br>
      So I quit my job, sold all my possessions and moved to London - one of the biggest tech hubs in the world. Serendipity and grit landed me a job at Monzo. Starting in customer support, I moved my way up to product manager within a year and a half. And since joining, the company‚Äôs grown from 250,000 to 3+ million customers, and 150 to 1,500+ employees. Let‚Äôs just say the learning curve has been steep üòâ

      <h2 id="whycoding">Why coding...</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôve always wanted to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù things, hence the initial desire to get into property. But more importantly, I want to create things that improve the lives of the less fortunate. Building sky rise apartments for the rich, and fancy commercial buildings for insurance companies, simply wasn‚Äôt compelling enough for me to jump out of bed in the morning. I also get a buzz from quick, tangible results - and well, glaciers can move faster than large-scale developments.
      <br>
      <br>
      Working at Monzo has opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities of code. I wanted to learn shortly after joining, but 50+ hours of work a week drained me of my energy.
      <br>
      <br>
      But the universe presented an opportunity with the coronavirus furlough scheme. To prevent redundancies the company asked for volunteers. I did some maths and could afford the pay cut. So I put my hand up and have decided to use the time to springboard my career into coding. This will inevitably mean no more Monzo as they aren‚Äôt able to take on junior developers, but after nearly 3 years, I'm ready for the next chapter.
      <br>
      <br>
      I initially started self teaching, but quickly realised I need the structure of a classroom to stay motivated. My close friend Kate Beard (Founders and Coders alumni) had the highest of praise and convinced me to apply.
      <br>
      <br>
      I‚Äôm incredibly excited by the prospect of finally becoming a full stack web developer, and intermixing my creative aspirations with the ability to build things that truly help people.
      <br>
      <br>
      I‚Äôm eternally grateful for your consideration of my application under these exceptional circumstances. And I hope I‚Äôm given the chance to show you what I‚Äôm truly capable of - I can assure I won‚Äôt let you down.
